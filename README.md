# Midnightblue
Our web app embraces the interconnected and peer-to-peer nature of the web, aiming to empower users with autonomy and choice in how they share and consume content. Inspired by projects like Diaspora and simplified alternatives to ActivityPub, this platform enables seamless interaction across nodes without relying on centralized networks like Facebook or Twitter. In this app, we are able to connect with other similar web apps to interact (view post, like/comment posts) with their users.
